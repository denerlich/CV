? Responsible for the set-up of BIM field operations, including execution plans, BIM manuals, contract addenda. Led the team in setup and integration of the VDC process with trade agreements, document control, design coordination and change management.

I was hired to EllisDon in March 2010, and spent couple of months in the office environment, preparing documentation for BIM deployments. Tom Strong just organized the department at that time, and hired his first employee, Chris Little from Allumination Ltd, and former MEP foreman from Modern Niagra. I was employee number two. We developed our first BIM execution plan from combination of Indiana University, USACE corps BIM document and VA BIM Execution Plan document ( At the time Penn State BxP did not exist yet).
Our first BIM- enabled project was KDC (Krimbel Discovery Centre in Downtown Toronto under UHC), this project was IPD ( Integrated Project Delivery) contract, and Revit- enabled BIM process was first tested by Tim Quinlan, our first VDC Coordinator. Project was essentially modelled by Architectural and Structural Consultants, and Black and Mackdonald Mechanical and Electrical partners of Ellisdon were responsibe for the process of MEP coordination of their own teams.

This project was a testing ground for my new role as BIM deployment manager, and established fairly scalable pattern for next years to come on multiple projects.

 As BIM/VDC deployment manager, I functionally managed and oversaw BIM program on the large P3 Hospital projects (Krembil Discovery Centre, Sick Kids Hospital, COT, Calgary International Airport, New Oakville Hospital, Surrey Memorial Hospital - Critical Care Tower, Waterpark Place Phase 3 Tower, Providence Health Care Hospital, Burlington's St Thomas Hospital Addition), Civil Infrastructure projects (VivaNext H3, H2, H2VMC Highway 7 East Rapid way), Data Centers ( Monteral Ericsson, Barrie TD Bank) with extensive experience leading and supporting BIM teams.I deployed, Trained and was personally involved with the following projects:Below is a list of jobsites, that I was personally envolved, trained and functionally managed:

Krimbel Discovery Centre, Toronto, ON (April 2010- July 2011); Surrey Memorial Hospital, BC (Jul 2011- Nov 2011);
VIVANext H3 Rapid Transit Project (Jul 2011 - Nov 2011); Sick Kids Hospital (Jan 2011 - Nov 2011);
Saskatoon Police HQ (Aug 2011 -Apr 2012);

My role included for writing Execution Plans, helping with BIM specification writing, budgeting, leading in-house modelling teams to support Field BIM, training of new-coming BIM coordinators to Interference management, document control, handling models, modelling techniques, understanding contract specifics, and various interoperability issues. Large portion of that role included for developing interpersonal skills and leadership and mentor skills.

During my time in Ellisdon, I re-wrote template BIM Execution manual of EllisDon, made BIM amendment to Contract's Appendix A of General Conditions in cooperation with Christian Wiechmann of Commercial Services & Project Controls at EllisDon.

At the same time, as BIM expanded it's application beyond clash detection, I was developing and operationalizing scanning services for Ellisdon's Geomatics Group, profit-and-loss group engaged in laser scanning of existing conditions for major renovation projects (Yorkdale Mall, Markham Mall Expansion, YYZ T3 Renovation etc.), that later became quite successful enterprise under Vincent Zhang.
on ICI and Civil job sites of Ellisdon. Trained, coached and supported EllisDon BIM personnel.

 Practical Experience

Referring to the instructions indicated on page 15 & 18, provide a detailed summary about the nature and complexity of work undertaken, in the specific discipline within the BIM process, demonstrating applied working knowledge and skills in the use of SIM-related software. It is recommended that descriptions be as specific as possible with examples where applicable. Direct references to the BIM process must be provided.
 Started as Project Coordinator at PCL's Bell LightBox project, on March 2008; after some time, I became involved with BIM deliverable by Allumination Ltd, company of Chris Little, that provided coordination model from KPMB ( Interior Design) and Kirkor Architects ( Main Design}. With the time, model became a challenge to manage by the field construction team, and I was reassigned as VDC Field Coordinator for the project;
I learned to use VIGO Software from literature and available training material i found online and with assistance from PCL Head office SIM Director Dan Neufeglise. Another software that I had to learn was Navisworks 2008 version.
At that time, main process that was supported by me was coordination of the models
( Architectural and Structural podium models) and deficiency detection in comparison with structural and architectural drawings, produced by architect. Both were in development, there were no definitive workflow to tell which was deficient,
With the help of Jim Stinson and Ken Lester, Project Superintendent and Project Manager, respectively, I mastered skill of reading construction documentation, identifying deficiencies in plan annotations and comparing plans with elevations and sections, effectively learning both skills of drawing reading and modelling.
My additional task on this project was to coordinate Doors and Door accessories with Door vendor Upper Canada. Later came Curtain wall vendor ( Flynn}, and coordination of the facade erection sequence through demonstration of specific erection times of glass elements.
During construction, my task was to document concrete pours and to get through the site with the laptop, identifying model problems and fixing them to represent as-built ( as­ construct} condition.

in the PCL headquarters , I was part of the VDC Modelling and coordinating team, working on the St Catherines Hospital project with specific specialization on the facade, exterior walls and precast veneer panels, along with the adjacent systems ( canopies, doors); Modelling was done in VIGO Graphisoft software ( later known as Archicad), with coordination and visualisation output in Autodesk Navisworks. I was inputing in PCL design review team, that was working with the Architect to coordinate and value engineer the facade system, and was looking at design optimisation and constructability issues with the facade elements, especially at the 3-dimensional connections of prefabricated panels with different veneers and trims to glass, steel and canopy roof connections, and essentially were developing these connection details using element mockups that I was modelling. This was extensive modelling exercise and Navisworks fly-throughs.Continue next page (if required)

Project scope included execution of Scanning and Data acquisition of the Jasper Park Lodge area to create as-built drawings for further utilization by the project team. My role included for identifying scope, budget, schedule for the work performance, including methods to acquire, process and present date to the client. Work had been accomplished in full scope, including follow up with the client, managing scope gaps and coordinating deficiencies.
During that time, technology to identify scanned elements from the pointcloud was in it's infancy, therefore It was my role to identify, choose correct and effective workflow and to train the team to conduct pointcloud registration, geolocate, collect wast amount of data from the pointcloud model and to trace existing utilites and generate SUE map based on markings of the utilities, left by the location team, model all the topographical features including building boundaries, treelines, sidewalks etc, and to incorporate all other information from the existing surveys of the location; produce tiled map and supply it to the design team for development of the proposed utilities plan. We utilized winter break utilized for in-house processing of the information.Continue next page (if required)

It is recommended that descriptions be as specific as possible with examples where applicable. Direct references to the BIM process must be provided.
During the project I was performing extensive training on established softwar packages, and also learning myself to use new software packages, as part of the CTSC BIM Execution Programme. This project utilized 4D scheduling software Synchro, and It was used by me to review, and to retrain upcoming specialists on the project, in order to maintain existing use cases on continuous basis.
We heavily used Microstation and Bentley InRoads to satisfy requirement for Metrolinx- compliant
We modelled all the Construction Support works in our group, as well as enchaced design models with additional model elements and metadata to provide for 4D scheduling and Quantity Takeoffs.
Laser Scanning was also used quirte extensively on some segments, so we did have a chance to remodel civil works and some of the retrofits ( Second Cup on Mt Pleasant, Kodak Building on EMSF), swats of areas on Segment 5 ( Don MIlls-Kennedy area).Continue next page (if required)

As part of quality control and progress assessment on the project, having about 120 models and counting Revit models, It was essential to automate review tasks, and create Quality Assessment Program for all the content. I created Dynamo library with automation scripts ( Dynamo Automation package with Master and Slave Graphs) that was producing counts of elements, checking classification, normalizing models by georeferencing them to the project; reporting on naming conventions of families, views , view sheets, checking on element counts and quality of elements in relation to GFA's of station and producing comparative reports to the upper management;

We introduced Solibri Model Checker as our flagship program for review of the model content; I created checking rules for 60% and 90% design progress; as well as worked with extensive amount of data to compare drawings with models. All this was automated sufficiently to allow our relatively small group ( 6 BIM leads and other BIM users) to control the arrival of design information and fairly assess the progress.

Later, when Trade models become available, we switched to Navisworks review workflow, as data sources became much more variative and quality of date somehow deteriorated to the point that it became less intelligent to handle in Solibri.

During my time at EllisDon, I have been involved with numerous projects setup; Althoug my primary role was BIM Deployment Manager, I was constantly and extensively developing new workflows with the new and existing software to accommodate with the emerging technologies and new ways of using BIM.
I personally was scanning and processing ( Cleaning, Registering) and modelling on projects such as H2VMC (CN Bridge), H3 ( HWY 7 Stops as-built data), Massey Hall Renovation Project ( Capturing existing interiors and exteriors and modeling existing conditions), Saskatoon Remai Moderna Art Museum, YYZ T3 Luggage System fit-in, Jasper ( featured separaely), Marhham Mall, London, ON. Sears Renovation, Yorkdale Expansion, Up Express Passenger Platform, Goderich Salt Mine, Ottawa CPP and many more.

As EllisDon Deployment Program always involved intensive training at the beginning of the job, it was imperative for me to personally train an emerging specialist on Navisworks, Revit, Civil3D and FARO software, as well as personally involved in some of the projects, whre overlap or additional training was required.
Some of the initiative, such as developing workflow for Civil 3D modelling for utilities coordination and for quantity takeoffs ( H3, H2, H2VMC) required additional extensive use of software that was not BIM-copmatible at the time, and required workarounds and creative solutions.Continue next page (if required)

It is recommended that descriptions be as specific as possible with examples where applicable. Direct references to the BIM process must be provided.
on October 23, 2018, I was hired as BIM manager for AECOM's Markham Buildings and Places office to support Design development of the TTC SSE Project - Scarborough Centre East Station, that included subway station, Drive and 2 Bus Stations (TTC and GO); project was underway for about 2 years at that point; BIM Execution Plan, Software work flows and Design development and Coordination processes well established, and design was undergoing 60% progress development.
BIM Manager role in the design environment is different from Construction side, as it primarily deals with issues of Design Delivery ( CADD), 2D work flows and various tasks of Drawings formatting. It was quite a challenge to get myself up and running in the Bentley AECOsim environment, pre configured in very specific way. Project had ProjectWise Common Data environment, that I undertook to improve by introducing Title Block Integration; I simplified composition structure of the models ( Model-
Master-Composition-Drawing-Sheet) and re-utilized Composition Models to be main contributor of the 3D data to sheets. Another challenge was to introduce 3 additional teams from Global Delivery Service from India, Barcelona and Baltimore, that utilized GrassHopper- generated parametric geometry converted to Revit via IFC format, and from Revit via IFC was converted to AECOsim dgn format; conversions required very careful
maintenance protocol; as welll extensive consultation with the Bentley Business Support unit on datagroup configurations and families and parts assignments.

Yet another challenge waas dealing with the issue of Grid and Ground Coordinate systems of geo-referencing, as Aecosim environment, though capable of handling Grid and Ground system, used localized coordinate as AECOsim model was designed in millimeter space for precision, while all the alignment information was delivered in Meter- based workspace and Global Origin; on top of that, Revit input does not have concept of Grid and Ground, and as such, can only be configured to generate drawings in one of the two references. Topic was pretty complex and convoluted even for advanced software users; it took about 1 month to develop a white paper in collaboration with Bentley Civil product line specialist, explaining the workflow of bringing all Revit, Civil and AECOsim products together. Among other things, Navisworks was extensively used for coordination of all the models; additional workflow that was successfully used was BIM 360 Docs next generation.Continue next page (if required)

Relief Line South was a project that AECOM undertook to design from 0% to 30% for possible extension to 60% and 100% ( Full design package for Tender).
Project contained 2 interchange stations in the Relief Line South, as well as tie- in the existing parking structure.
Beside a trivial BIM setup and BIM Execution configuration of the project, as part of design work flow and reduction of the design cost, I undertook the imitative to create automated process of Revit- based design production and conversion to TTC- compatible deliverable in form of 2D DGN models.
I developed a software pipeline with extensive use of Micro station Batch Script language and conversion tables on the Revit side, complete replacement of out-of-the-box Revit configuration by TTC- modified layout, that was deriving it's format and families graphics from TTC CADD Package; I established specific Views and Sheet views organization, as well as vocabulary checker, that is normalizing Sheet content description to the match standardized abbreviated name of the sheet file and view names corresponding to the Master file names; Also, with help and assistance of GDS India team, we developed custom families for all mechanical and electrical annotation content, and were able to produce Revit PDF that were indistinguishable from PDF's produced from Bentley Micro station.
At the same time, DGN deliverables needed to be normalized and assigned with proper global origin location, design space scale, moved from design to model space etc. Work is effectively completed and now is a proprietary knowledge of AECOM Canada for future use.with the Transportation client.Continue next page (if required)

my first BIM - enabled project with EllisDon was KDC (Krimbel Discovery Centre in Downtown Toronto under UHC), this project was IPD ( Integrated Project Delivery) contract, and Revit- enabled BIM process . Project was essentially modelled by Architectural and Structural Consultants, and Black and Mackdonald Mechanical and Electrical partners of Ellisdon were responsible for the process of MEP coordination of their own teams.

This project was a testing ground for my new role as BIM deployment manager, and established fairly scalable pattern for next years to come on multiple projects.

Project included for setting up BIM process on the Krimbel discovery Centre construction project for EllisDon Construction management team, integration of the Virtual Design and Construction process in Design and Construction activities ( Project Document Control, Assessment of the scope of modeling, capabilities of Consultants, Trades and ED Team, Directing Consultant's design work with BIM Implementation, defining BIM Scope,

training of BIM Coordinator and assistance. Main issues that were dealt with, included for unclear job definition of VDC Coordinator ( as he often wore a modeller hat, designer hat and trade hat, which was in conflict of interest and often created "imaginary wishful model" that was not backed up by proper change management process; another issue was ever changing scope of clashes and what should constitute "clash - free" model.
Most challenging was a perception of BIM as a novel process that promised magical solutions and was under-delivering; while none of the participants saw themselve part of the BIM team, and looked at VDC/BIM coordinator to deliver answers;Continue next page (if required)

Sick Kids Hospital job was one of the most challenging to go through, as it involved subcontracting of Mechanical and later Electrical work to BIM modelling company on a lump sum contract basis. Consultant has very different BIM modelling style, that was based on non- elaborative one-time LOD 400 level model production with pre- coordination effort done on paper with 2D drawings. in that ennvironment, benefit of BIM Coordination is completely lost, and realistically, the deliverable is only a final model with dubious coordination quality, entirely dependant on the quality of the coordination sketches and without input of coordination team. This job was a "war of opinions and experiences" where common sense was often the only way to referee the situation. This coordination process resulted in fast depletion of the budget that was allotted for coordination, and replacement of the coordination entity by outsourcing company, that introduced different kind of complexity o the process, involving difficulty of understanding issues and latency of the response by the outsorced actor, associated with work in the different time zone. This job taught me value of perception, resourcefulness, and timing of effort spended, that sometimes modelling once is not the best economical strategy.Continue next page (if required)

It is strongly recommended that descriptions be as specific as possible with examples where applicable. Direct references to items indicated on pages 40 and 41 must be provided.

on October 23, 2018, I was hired as BIM manager for AECOM's Markham Buildings and Places office.
B+P as a Design Consultant has different need and level of BIM adoption than Construction environment. My role as BIM manager is still unfolding.
My understanding of the role is growing as I learn the ropes of the business environment of Architectural and Engineering Consultant, and it's strategy in response to Government Clients portfolio. Company has wast resources, including Global Delivery Services and multi-region core BIM team with it's robust processes and teams to tap to. Since October I strategically placed myself in the interdiscipline environment, being accessible not only by the Architectural Department, but also leveraging my interdisciplinary experience to reach out to all disciplines and engineerinc consultants, as well as being instrumental to Project Management Team in supporting Document Control and Coordination processes, and constantly pushing limits of established paper-driven processes.
At the moment, I am developing Process driven ( as oppose to paper- driven) Design BPM somehow based on OAA and AIA practices, introducing ISO 19650 - driven methodology of model progression and concepts of Common Data Environment, thereby departing from CADD- driven workflows and introducing process-oriented design development and coordination. over the past 10 month, i intimately understood practice of Bentley AECOsim setup and it's production challenges, and was able to pick up the abandoned BIM process and to establish "fall-back" safety net for the design team by streamlining product support via multiple Bentley Business support groups, using SharePoint p2p internet hub;
Organizing "Raising issue" meetings with Software specialists; Developing instructional videos and white paper to support project needs.

Realizing, that in the cash- strapped and overhead- lean projectized environment, all the R&D should be done "after hours" and to bring proven results to the team, approach is to raise talent "on the go" and "from within";
There is a need to automate and integrate tasks so it will became fabric of the daily life of the design firm;
Most importantly, not to over- burdent production floor with "yet another layer" of support service, and instead make evryone a BIM user and participant, not a BIM "consumer"
In this environment, leveraging the system resources is the key.Continue next page (if required)

I started my deployment on the project 2 months before official start of the project. After preliminary review of the contract language pertaining Service Agreement between Design JV and Construction JV, and the Project Agreement, I identified statutory role of BIM on the project and the main stakeholder with vested interest in BIM outcomes to be Constructor JV (CTSD); whereas our client ( Project CO) and our client's Client ( Metrolinx) were primarily interested in implicit benefits of BIM, while not explicitly requiring the approach. Main challenges of the BIM programme, therefore, became un- mandated nature of BIM, proof of the benefit to the Constructor JV and induction of proper procedure of creating BIM process on the Consultant JV side, where Consultant had it's own issues with organizing it's mosaic team, comprised of several non-core consultancies ( Core consultancy group being SNC Lavalin- IBI partnership, where numerous consultants, such as NORR, RJC, Lea, and others were hired on a lump sum basis to support to the Design services up to Construction Documentation, and had very different levels of engagement on the project from expertise, internal organization, project effort and workload.
Additional challenge was to identify gaps in Constructor's JV coverage of the contract requirement. Certain disciplines - such as SUE, Topographical survey and geometry Control of the project, have not been answered at the time of BIM deployment; as well Document Control did not include for Common Data Environment organization in the proposal; Asset Classifications documentation, as well as Quality Control Plan and Project Control Plan have not been addressing unique configuration of the Design Build contract, and instead addressed EPC ( Engineering Procurement Construction ) type of contract, without proper organization of procurement process with adequate staffing. I took temporary roles of Chief Surveying Manager, Data Manager and assistant to Procurement process, in order to establish and influence these processes, as absence or inadequate configuration of these would lead to deficiency in supply of BIM data, a lot of rework and efectively would render BIM effort expensive and marginally efficient.
Additional challenge on the project was very different level of CADD and BIM proficiency of modellers and drafters. Project's challenge was to deal with complexity of Revit and AutoCAD- based skill sets of the majority of the domestic and overseas talent, as well as demand for Autodesk- based outputs by the Trades ( on the local market), and rigit contract requirement by Metrolinx and TTC to supply documentation in Bentley Microstation format.
Design stakeholder ( Designer JV) provided for their own CADD and BIM Managers, that pursued somewhat similar agendas with Constructor JV, with shortfalls of talent, training, tough delivery schedule, untested mechanism of design delivery under DB contract to Metrolinx. this required from me to establish rigorous progress assessment regime of approximately 120 models ( 5 models per typical station of total 15 stations, EMSF facility, Existing models and Tunnel structure).
I handpicked my first BIM coordinators for the project ( 6 in total), and allowed for 3-4 month time to acuire skills and proficiencyh in modelling and interoperability studies for Revit, Microstation, Descartes , Bentley Navigator, Navisworks, AECOsim ,InRoads and AutoCAD programs,Continue next page (if required)


Continued (if required)
I rolled out 4-5 weekly in-class training sessions for MicroStation users, and one weekly session for Inroads.
Together with Training Manager, we created program for online Autodesk training with specific training context.
Together with IT Manager, we established independent Bentley Project Wise Common Data Environment with fully featured workflows, connecting drafting and Construction Support CDE with Design CDE and developing business process for Document Control team operation.
As project was evolving, additional tasks came to attention of the BIM group. Construction phase brought additional challenge of construction documentation utilizing BIM technology. As multidisciplinary approach, I always believed that BIM is a process that aims to integrate and if possible, automate AEC deliverables, and that goes beyond utilization of software, and extends to redefining role of the key players in the design and construction process.
Estimators, Schedulers, Design Managers, Document Controllers, IT support, Procurement, Construction- all shall be looked at as BIM participant, and that is impossible without redefining their roles in the process.
I reviewed contract language of Service Agreement, and with assistance with the Project Legal Council created internal narrative, justifying specific requests of the Constructor to demand certain level of BIM delivery from the Designer group; as well, we amended General Conditions and Procurement Scope of Work documentation with technical description of minimum BIM requirements from specific vendors; We created Technical Specifications addressing Model delivery in Technical Specifications, especially divisions 23-48
( Mechanical and Electrical); in conjunction with Survey team, we developed interface language for Surveyors and to Tradesmen on accurate layout procedures for station's mechanical and Electrical elements;
During critical period of renegotiation of the contract schedule with the City of Toronto, our team created stunning 4D animations of the critical path construction sequences and the "blue sky" initiatives, demonstrating alternative road closures and TTMP plans, allowing us to compress time with specific allowances from the City and enabling Crosslinx to finish project in time.

My last significant initiative on the project was to develop As-Built program as part of the construction- commissioning phase planning. This was truly team effort with influx of knowledge on the topic from recent graduates of JV partners, that experienced

Responsible for the set-up of BIM field operations, including execution plans, BIM manuals, contract addenda. Led the team in setup and integration of the VDC process with trade agreements, document control, design coordination and change management.
I was hired to EllisDon in March 2010, and spent couple of months in the office environment, preparing documentation for BIM deployments. Tom Strong just organized the department at that time, and hired his first employee, Chris Little from Allumination Ltd, and former MEP foreman from Modern Niagra. I was employee number two. We developed our first BIM execution plan from combination of Indiana University, USACE corps BIM document and VA BIM Execution Plan document ( At the time we were not aware of Penn State BxP template). Our first BIM- enabled project was KDC (Krimbel Discovery Centre in Downtown Toronto under UHC), this project was IPD ( Integrated Project Delivery) contract, and Revit- enabled BIM process was first tested by Tim Quinlan, our first VDC Coordinator. Project was essentially modelled by Architectural and Structural Consultants, and Black and Mackdonald Mechanical and Electrical partners of Ellisdon were responsibe for the process of MEP coordination of their own teams.
This project was a testing ground for my new role as BIM deployment manager, and established fairly scalable pattern for next years to come on multiple projects.
As BIM/VDC deployment manager, I functionally managed and oversaw BIM program on the large P3 Hospital projects (Krembil Discovery Centre, Sick Kids Hospital, COT, Calgary International Airport, New Oakville Hospital, Surrey Memorial Hospital - Critical Care Tower, Waterpark Place Phase 3 Tower, Providence Health Care Hospital), Civil Infrastructure projects (VivaNext H3, H2, H2VMC Highway 7 East Rapid way), Data Centers ( Monteral Ericsson, Barrie TD Bank) with extensive experience leading and supporting BIM teams.
This included training of new-coming BIM coordinators to Interference management, document control, handling models, modelling techniques, understanding contract specifics, and various interoperability issues. Large portion of that role included for developing interpersonal skills and leadership and mentor skills. During my time in Ellisdon, I re-wrote template BIM Execution manual of EllisDon, made BIM amendment to Contract's Appendix A of General Conditions in cooperation with Christian Wiechmann of Commercial
Services & Project Controls at EllisDon. At the same time, as BIM expanded it's application beyond clash detection, I was developing and operationalizing scanning services for Ellisdon's Geomatics Group, profit-and-loss group engaged in laser scanning of existing conditions for major renovation projects (Yorkdale Mall, Markham Mall Expansion, YYZ T3 Renovation etc.), that later became quite successful enterprise under Vincent Zhang.
